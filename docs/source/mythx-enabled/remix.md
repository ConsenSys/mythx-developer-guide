# MythX-Enabled Remix


Remix is a powerful, open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser. Written in JavaScript, Remix supports both usage in the browser and locally.
Read more about it [here](https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

MythX integration into Remix should be done sometime this year.
