=====================

"Truffle" is a world-class development environment, testing framework
and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier. Read more about it
on the [truffle suite
website](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/overview).

We have written a `truffle "run" plugin
<https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/writing-external-scripts>`_
that runs `MythX <https://mythx.io>`_ Smart Contract analyses on
truffle projects.
