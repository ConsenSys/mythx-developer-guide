MythX-Enabled VSCode Truffle Extension
======================================

We are currently working with Microsoft to get this into the planned Microsoft VSCode extension for Truffle.

Note: in contrast to `truffle-analyze <https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle-analyze>`_, this integrates MythX's reports into the VSCode's IDE.
