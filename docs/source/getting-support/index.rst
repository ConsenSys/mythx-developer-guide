MythX support
=============

There are multiple ways to get in touch with us, whether you want to get help using MythX, develop an integration, or give feedback.


* You can connect with the MythX team by joining the `MythX Community <https://community.mythx.io>`_.

* To get support for third-party tools it is usually best to communicate directly with the tool developers. For example:

  * If you run into an issue with the :ref:`MythX plugin for Truffle <tools.truffle>`, create an issue in its `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle-security>`_.
  * For issues with the :ref:`MythX Remix plugin <tools.remix>`, you can create an issue in the `Remix plugin GitHub repository <https://github.com/aquiladev/remix-mythx-plugin/>`_ as well.

* For direct support, please go to `mythx.io <https://mythx.io>`_ and click the :guilabel:`Contact` link.

We always want to hear from you, so thank you for getting in touch.
