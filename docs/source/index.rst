   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

This guide covers all sorts of ways to use, develop and interact with MythX.

`MythX <https://mythx.io>`_ is a security analysis API for Ethereum
smart contracts. It powers tools that bring security into the
smart-contract software development life cycle.

Join the MythX community at `MythX Discord <https://discord.gg/kktn8Wt>`_ for more information.

This guide is aimed at these classes of uses:

- I want to contribute to existing MythX development (I think it is cool)
- I want to use MythX as a developer in my development/project workflow
- I have a security tool that I would like to integrate into the MythX backend
- I have a complete product or service that I want to integrate with MythX

The first section below covers information needed by everyone, and the
following sections cover those listed above in order.
