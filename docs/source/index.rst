MythX Documentation
===================

`MythX <https://mythx.io>`_ is a security analysis API that allows anyone to create purpose-built security tools for smart contract developers. Tools built on MythX integrate seamlessly into the development environments and continuous integration pipelines used throughout the Ethereum ecosystem. 

This guide covers all sorts of ways to use, develop and interact with MythX.
It has been built for the following use cases:

- I want to use MythX as a developer in my development/project workflow
- I want to contribute to existing MythX development (I think it is cool)
- I have a security tool that I would like to integrate into the MythX backend
- I have a complete product or service that I want to integrate with MythX

The first section below covers information needed by everyone, and the
following sections cover those listed above in order.
