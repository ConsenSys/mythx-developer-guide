JavaScript API Interface
========================

If you want to add MythX analysis into a Javacscript-based program as
we have done to truffle in `truffle-analyze <../mythx-enabled/truffle-analyze>`_, or
`vscode-solidity <../mythx-enabled/vscode-solidity>`_, you can use the same libraries that we use.

A thin wrapper around the MythX API is called `armlet`. We are also working on
a more beefy software development kit for Javascript called `mythx-js-sdk`.
