You *love* developing in `Piet <https://esolangs.org/wiki/Piet>`_ but
there is no MythX library available? You are working on integration
with an IDE, a neat web interface, or something else that's super
useful? If you're builing things on MythX we'd like to know about it!

We're currently working on a revenue sharing system that will pay
back a percentage of all revenues generated by the API to tool developers.
The system will be put into place once we start offering paid subscription
plans (presumably later this year). More details will be announced soon.

Please join our growing community on `Discord <https://discord.gg/kktn8Wt>`_
and reach out to the team for more information.
