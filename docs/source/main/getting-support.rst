There are multiple ways to get in touch with us, whether you want to get
help using MythX, you need support, or want to give feedback.


For MythX Tool Developers

If you're building tools on MythX API you can reach out to our team on the
following channels:

For MythX Tool Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get support for third-party tools built it is usually best to communicate
directly with the tool developers. For example, if you run into an issue with the
Truffle plugin, create an issue in the `Truffle Security repository <https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle-security>`_. You can also get help at:

- `Discord: #mythx-support <https://discord.gg/E3YrVtG>`_
