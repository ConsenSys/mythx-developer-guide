~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're building tools on MythX API you can reach out to our team on the
following channels:

- `Github repository for developer support and API bug reports <https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythx-developer-support>`_ - create an issue here if you encounter crashes, errors, false positives or false negatives.
- `Discord: #mythx-tool-developers <https://discord.gg/dZTvEzA>`_ - general chat for MythX builders.
- `Discord: #api-bugs <https://discord.gg/uXyHdyU>`_ - Discord channels for reporting bugs in the MythX service.

Alternatively, contact our helpdesk at  at `support [at] mythx.io`.

For MythX Tool Users
=======

To get support for third-party tools built it is usually best to communicate
directly with the tool developers. For example, if you run into an issue with the MythX Security Analysis plugin for Truffle, create an issue in the `repository <https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle-security>`_. You can also get help at:

- `Discord: #mythx-support <https://discord.gg/E3YrVtG>`_
- MythX helpdesk: `support [at] mythx.io`
