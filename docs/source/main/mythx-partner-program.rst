MythX Partner Ecosystem
=====================

Integration partners are granted the right to use the MythX security analysis
stack to power their own security systems, tools, plug-ins and power-ups.
This allows them to build a wide variety of innovative and useful products and
services without the high upfront cost for R&D. In turn, these products and
services help drive usage of the MythX platform.

MythX is an extensible platform that lends itself very well to integrating with various types of 3rd party partners.  We encourage co-development of platform features, and also act as an open REST API that partner tools and services can easily call in order to retrieve security analysis results for smart contracts or byte code.  We also have custom business development agreements with various entities but in general we have Platform Integration Partners and System Development Partners who have formal signed agreements with the MythX team.

Platform Integration Partner
Platform integration partners are granted the right to use the proprietary MythX Platform security analysis stack. This allows them to build a wide variety of innovative and useful products and services that leverage MythX without having to incur the high upfront cost for R&D. In turn, they help drive usage of the MythX Platform and increase overall security of Ethereum.

System Development Partner
System Development Partners are companies and organizations that are instrumental in building out MythX Platform. They contribute code to Mythril Classic (OSS) and Platform API, or even contribute new analysis modules that improve the quality of the platform. 

Agreements with system development partners may take many different forms or none at all in the Mythril Classic case. For example, the partner might provide some IP and/or resources for free or at a reduced rate. In exchange, the partner may earn a revenue share or other types of benefits.

Partner Examples
IDE Vendor
IDEs such as Truffle or Visual Studio can build integrations with MythX Platform API to seamlessly include security verification into the Smart Contract Secure Development Life Cycle. For example, Truffle could integrate security analysis as a built-in command (e.g. "truffle analyze"). When a user executes this command, a new MythX user with the free plan is automatically created. The free plan allows users to execute the command up to a certain limit. Users who wish to increase the limit are asked to purchase a paid plan on the MythX website and enter their API password into the Truffle configuration file.

CI Automation Service Providers
Companies such as SonarQube and GuardRails automate security in the CI pipeline. By integrating MythX platform these companies can add support for Ethereum projects to their products. 

Smart Contract Insurance Provider
Smart contract insurance providers can integrate MythX API to verify base security requirements in the insured smart contracts. 

Security Services Provider
Partners who provide security services, smart contract assessments or audits can decide to take advantage of the full version of MythX API to enhance their security offerings.

Monitoring Service
Blockchain monitoring and visualization services such as Alethio and Etherscan can integrate with MythX API to verify changes in contracts deployed to MainNet and discover vulnerabilities or behavioral or transactional anomalies in live systems.

Nexus Portal and Directory
MythX Nexus is a portal and directory for tenant products and services that would benefit from a command center and launch pad.  In the near future, any web3 dapp or service should want to have an entry in the Nexus to take advantage of features and services that remove friction from n-sided transactions. It is a directory that we will promote and an additional business channel for web3 entities.

You may have your own canned security pipeline and you would like to take
advantage of MythX's ability to authenticate, track and scale. If so contact
us.
