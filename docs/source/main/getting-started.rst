What is MythX?
--------------
`MythX <https://mythx.io>`_ is a security analysis API for Ethereum smart
contracts. It detects many common vulnerabilities in Solidity code and EVM
bytecode. Anyone can use MythX to build purpose-built Ethereum security tools.

Smart contract developers use MythX tools, such as plugins,
IDE extensions and CI scripts, which are easy to install and work out-of-the-box. 

For more information, announcements and support, consider joining the
`MythX Discord <https://discord.gg/kktn8Wt>`_ server.
