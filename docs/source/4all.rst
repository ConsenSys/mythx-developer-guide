Pick a Plan

New users will be directed to the license plans page. Here you can start with

A Note on Payments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you purchase a plan any unused DAI will be refunded if and when the
users chooses to cancels the subscription. For example:

A user can choose 10x daily plan which fills their “fuel tank” with 10 DAI.
The MythX API tracks usage of the account and 1 DAI is burned for each 24
hours activation. Unused DAI are refunded if and when a user cancels their
subscription.
