What is MythX?
--------------
`MythX <https://mythx.io>`_ is a security analysis API for Ethereum Smart
Contracts. It is aimed at smart contract developers to tailor security into
their Software Development Lifecycle as well as Smart Contract auditors. By
providing an easy-to-use endpoint to in-depth security analysis, MythX is
meant to turbocharge the rapid development of applications for the Ethereum
blockchain in a sustainable and secure way.

Under the hood, MythX leverages `Mythril Classic <https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril-classic/>`_
as well as other tools we have developed in-house at `ConsenSys Diligence <https://consensys.net/diligence/>`_
to make our auditors' life easier. MythX is out way of making the combined
power of static and dynamic program analysis, as well as dynamic input
fuzzing available to the community to maintain a high security standard in
a rapidly progressing ecosystem.

For more information, announcements and support, consider joining the
`MythX Discord <https://discord.gg/kktn8Wt>`_ server.
