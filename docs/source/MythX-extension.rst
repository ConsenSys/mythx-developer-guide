Plugging into the MythX platform
=================================

In the last section we described tools that a Smart Contract developer can use to harness the power of MythX.
Of course, this doesn't cover all of the possible tools and services that could benefit by hooking into MythX.
So this section is for programmers and entrepreneurs who want to integrate MythX analysis into an IDE or
enhance their service with MythX analysis.

`MythX API <https://staging.api.mythx.io/v1/openapi>`_ is the specification and ultimate authority.

However we have some libraries to facilitate using the API.
